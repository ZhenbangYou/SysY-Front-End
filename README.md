# SysY-Front-End: a One-Pass Code Generator
# Brief Introduction
This code generator translates SysY in to Eeyore.
For the definition of SysY, see [here](https://pku-minic.github.io/online-doc/#/sysy/). Basically, it is a subset of C.
For the definition of Eeyore,see [here](https://pku-minic.github.io/online-doc/#/ir/eeyore). It is an intermediate representation (IR) for compilers that translate C into RISC-V.
I feel it quite necessary to record my thoughts about the planning and developing of this project, which is exactly the origin of this README.
